Hi, I’m @glam0101

I'm learning how to create online environments and pretty digital spaces (sort of like architecture !)
I've started with the basics, html, css ect. ect.

I'm interested in cyber-theory, design, creating cool things for people to explore basically. I'm inspired right 
now by brutalism, early 2000s webdesign, and writers like Haraway and Gibson.
