Hi, I’m @glam0101

I'm learning how to create online environments digital spaces (digital architecture) 
I upload all of my projects here to archive and share them.

I'm interested in cyber-theory, design, creating cool things for people to explore basically. I'm inspired right 
now by early 2000s webdesign.
